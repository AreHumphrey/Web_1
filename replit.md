# Project Overview

## Overview

This is a minimal web project with a basic HTML/CSS structure. The repository contains two empty files - `index.html` and `style.css` - indicating this is either a new project starting point or a template for a simple static website. The project appears to be in its initial setup phase with no implemented functionality yet.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Static Web Architecture**: Uses plain HTML and CSS without any JavaScript frameworks
- **File Structure**: Simple two-file structure with separated concerns (HTML for content, CSS for styling)
- **Styling Approach**: External CSS file linked to HTML for maintainable styling

### Design Decisions
- **Simplicity First**: Chosen minimal setup suggests focus on lightweight, fast-loading web pages
- **No Build Process**: Direct HTML/CSS approach eliminates need for compilation or bundling
- **Separation of Concerns**: HTML and CSS are kept in separate files for better maintainability

## External Dependencies

Currently no external dependencies are identified in this minimal setup. The project uses:
- **Browser APIs**: Standard HTML5 and CSS3 supported by modern web browsers
- **No Third-party Libraries**: Pure vanilla web technologies without external frameworks or libraries
- **No Backend Services**: Static frontend-only architecture
- **No Database**: No data persistence layer implemented
